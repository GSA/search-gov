        a position for a full tour of duty without unreasonable disruption because

        you are covered by a FEHB Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) since you
        will be outside of the geographic area from which the FEHB carrier accepts
        enrollments or provides coverage. You may contact the Government Retirement
        & Benefits (GRB) Platform for further information. The link for GRB contact

        When deployed with the DoD-EC Workforce in a TDY status, you are eligible
        to continue your current Federal Employees Group Life Insurance Coverage (FEGLI);
        deployment does not cancel FEGLI coverage. Additionally, if you deploy in
        support of a contingency operation and if as a civilian employee you have
        previously waived some or all FEGLI coverage, you may elect the following
        FEGLI coverage outside an open season, without experiencing a qualifying life
        event, and without providing medical information: Basic coverage; and if you
        already have or elect Basic, you may also may elect Option A (Standard) coverage,
        and/or Option B (Additional) coverage. To elect/increase your FEGLI coverage
        once you receive your official offer letter, you may call the Benefits line
        at 1-888-320-2917, option 4. All eligible employees may participate in the
        Thrift Savings Plan while deployed. There is NO entitlement to temporary storage
        of household goods while deployed in a TDY status. For additional information
        on other benefits/entitlements refer to the Air Force Expeditionary Civilian
