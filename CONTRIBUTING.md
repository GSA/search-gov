Contributing to Search.gov
=========================
The search-gov repository includes the work of multiple contributors. You're encouraged to submit [pull requests](https://github.com/GSA/search-gov/pulls), [propose features and discuss issues](https://github.com/GSA/search-gov/issues).

#### Contributing to Search.gov Multilingual Search Support
Note: As of November 2021, management of multilingual support has moved from the [GSA/Punchcard](https://github.com/GSA/punchcard/) repository to the [GSA/search-gov](https://github.com/GSA/search-gov) repository.

The search-gov application uses the YAML files in [config/locales](config/locales) to provide localized translations of text strings based on the locale set for the user.

You can edit existing files or create new files directly via the [Github web interface](config/locales). Or, you can use Git from the command line (see below). Either way, follow these steps to create a new localization file:

1. Start with `non_es_en_template.yml` and copy it into your new locale file. The reason you are using `non_es_en_template.yml` and not `en.yml` or `es.yml` is because the English and Spanish locale files contain many translations that are not used in other locales.
1. Change the two letter locale in line 1 of your new file from `non_es_en_template` to match the locale of the filename.
1. Be sure to follow the instructions for date-related fields like `cdr_format`, `date_format`, and `slashes`. Case is important!
1. Be careful with preserving any opening/closing quotes around strings.
1. Once you have the file ready, copy/paste it into a [YAML validator](http://www.yamllint.com) to ensure what you have is valid YAML.
1. Commit the change in Github to a feature branch.

#### Fork the Project

If you don't want to use the [Github web interface](https://github.com/GSA/search-gov/fork), you can use the command line tools to fork the [project on Github](https://github.com/GSA/search-gov) and check out your copy.

Instructions on how to fork a project can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

#### Create a Topic Branch

Make sure your fork is up-to-date and create a topic branch for your feature or bug fix.

```
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```

#### Commit Changes

Make sure git knows your name and email address:

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
```

Writing good commit logs is important. A commit log should describe what changed and why.

```
git add ...
git commit
```

#### Push

```
git push origin my-feature-branch
```

#### Make a Pull Request

[Create a PR](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to propose your changes. A series of automated tests will run on [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/GSA/punchcard), and a checklist will be automatically inserted into the body of the PR. You may ignore the following items:
* If your changes will be tested manually, you have run bundle update and committed your changes to Gemfile.lock
* PR title is either of the format SRCH-#### <description> matching the associated Jira ticket (i.e. "SRCH-123 implement feature X"), or Release #.#.# matching the release number
* Your primary commit message is of the format SRCH-#### <description> matching the associated Jira ticket
* You have specified an "Assignee", and if necessary, additional reviewers

If tests pass and the other checklist items are complete, your pull request will usually get reviewed and accepted within a few days.

#### Thank You

Please do know that we really appreciate and value your time and work.
