As a result the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Social Security Administration (SSA) operate the E-Verify Program, a nationally available internet-based program that allows employers to electronically verify whether newly hired employees are eligible to work in the United States.  Use of E-Verify Program is voluntary in most states, but its use has become mandatory for all employers in several states, including Arizona, Mississippi, and South Carolina.  In addition, several other states have enacted legislation mandating the use of E-Verify by certain types of employers such as public contractors, state and local government agencies, or public entities.  This increased use of E-Verify together with the focus on employer verification of employment eligibility as an integral part of proposed comprehensive reform legislation makes evaluation of E-Verify's impacts through basic research critical to identifying specific areas for improvement.Research and evaluations are particularly salient in light of the number of employers who will be using the system in the event that mandatory use of E-Verify becomes national policy.  Its use has involved approximately 5 million new hires per year, or about 10 percent of the national total. Mandatory verification would expand that usage to more than 50 million hiring decisions annually involving 8 million employers and 144 million workers and more than 50 million hiring decisions each year. Identifying impacts, both positive and negative, of E-Verify usage is important to anticipating the effects of increased usage. To date, evaluations of the E-Verify Program have focused on obtaining quantitative and qualitative information on how the Program itself is working, both nationally and among specific groups of employers, and how it might be improved. The expectation has been that this information will help inform future legislation and policy-making, improve E-Verify Program administration, and lead to enhancements of the E-Verify Program.",Other,Survey: Non Disclosure Agreement, , ,Attachment G Non Disclosure Agreement.pdf, ,Yes,No,Printable Only,Homeland Security,Border and Transportation Security,Individuals or Households1615-0120,201106-1615-004,ICR Exist w/o OMB,1600,DHS,Department of Homeland Security,1615,USCIS,U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services,Civics and Citizenship Toolkit/Teacher Training Registration,Civics and Citizenship Toolkit/Teacher Training Registration,No,9/22/11,9/30/14,"Section 312 of the Immigration and Nationality Act requires immigrants aspiring for U.S. citizenship to have a ""knowledge and understanding of the fundamentals of the history, and of the principles and form of government, of the United States.""

U.S. chemical industry direct employment is about 850,000 (2009 per American Chemistry Council); approximately 400,000 employees are estimated as potential participants. Estimated duration in the first year to complete the registration, training, and survey is 60 minutes, and less if individuals do ""refresher"" in succeeding years. Minimal participation data is collected as trainees complete the on-line exercises. Upon completion, a Certificate of Completion is generated at the trainee's computer work station, printed and optionally e-mailed to a facility supervisor.
