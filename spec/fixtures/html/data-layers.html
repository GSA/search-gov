    <h2>Ocean Exploration and Research (OER) Digital Atlases</h2>
		<h3>Caribbean Sea</h3>
		<h4>Description</h4>
		<p>
			This map aids the public in locating surveys carried out by NOAA's Office of Exploration and Research (OER) in the
			Caribbean Sea.  Data collected by these cruises can be viewed with historical information, such as multibeam surveys
			and sediments for the area.
		</p>
		<h4>Layers</h4>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight">Buoys from National Data Buoy Center (NDBC)</span>- This layer contains the locations of
			buoys as well as support information for buoys listed on NDBC's home page. These buoys are located in open water
			and observe surface and physical ocean measurements.
		</p>

		<p>
			<span class="highlight">Coastal Watersheds</span>- This layer provides a consistently derived, watershed-based digital
			spatial framework. The framework is composed of 150 estuarine (and subestuarine) drainage areas (EDA), 54 fluvial
			drainage areas (FDA), 324 coastal drainage areas (CDA), 12 fluvial components of coastal drainage areas (FCDA),
			and 11 interior watershed areas. This data set encompasses 100 percent of the land area within the conterminous
			United States.
		</p>

		<p>
			<span class="highlight">Exclusive Economic Zone</span>- This layer provides the basic extent of the 200-nautical-mile
			exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and maritime boundary of the United States. The EEZ consists of those areas adjoining
			the territorial sea of the U.S., the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands,
			and U.S. overseas territories and possessions.
		</p>

		<p>
			<span class="highlight">Land Masses</span>- These layers contain countries that make up North and South America.
		</p>

		<p>
			<span class="highlight">Major Cities</span>- This layer has locations for World cities. This layer includes the name,
			state, and country where the city is located.
		</p>

		<p>
			<span class="highlight">Office of Exploration - Bonaire 2008</span>- These layers provide the information collected
			by the AUV submersibles during the period of January 7 through 30, 2008. Submersible information includes depth and
			sound velocity measurements.  There are also links to the daily logs stored at the Ocean Explorer website.
		</p>

		<p>
			<span class="highlight">Shaded Relief</span>- This image contains the color shaded relief map of the conterminous
			United States was created from 15 arc-second digital elevation model (DEM) data.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight">Shoreline</span>- This layer provides a medium-resolution digital shoreline of the United
			States. It was compiled from over 270 NOAA Nautical Charts.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight">States</span>- This layer represents the 50 states and the District of Columbia of the United
			States along with Mexican states with coastlines, international boundaries, state boundaries, and demographics. It
			is based on the Census Bureau's 1:2 million scale county geography.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight">Surficial Sediment Samples</span>- This layer contains the sediment descriptions for over
			36,000 seafloor samples worldwide. It includes date of collection, water depth of collection, sampling device,
			dominant lithology, secondary lithology, and a brief sample description. This information is maintained by the
			National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC).
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="highlight">World Relief Image</span>- This image represents cloud-free view of the Earth produced by
			mosaicking hundreds of individual 1996 NOAA weather satellite images. The land areas were enhanced with shaded relief
			imagery, derived from 1,000-m digital elevation data. For the ocean areas, WorldSat incorporated ocean-floor relief
			data bathymetry
