        through law schools in their region for local openings. We always welcome
        inquiries from students at other schools that we''re not able to visit. Each
        year, a number of second-year students apply for and are selected to participate
        in our Summer Law Clerk Program. Our clerks have an opportunity to undertake
        a variety of projects and visit naval activities, such as the Naval Air Station
        or board a Navy ship. Each fall, a number of offers (\"advance commitments\")

        \"advance commitments,\" will begin work after they have completed law school
        and after taking the bar exam. This position is in the Excepted Service and
