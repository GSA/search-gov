        technologies and well-tested best practices to multiply our impact on small
        businesses. America''s 28 million small businesses are the engine of job creation
        and economic growth in this country, creating nearly two out of every three
        new jobs in the United States and employing over half the nation''s workforce.
        SBA ensures that these businesses have the tools and resources required to
