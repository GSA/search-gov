  By default, [our Search Results API](#{site_api_instructions_path(@site)}) returns web results from our own indexes. If you don’t want to use the web results from our indexes, you can get web results from Bing or Google by buying an API key.


  ## Check Your Search Analytics


  Before buying a key, check your historical level of monthly transactions.


  1. Opt to view **unfiltered analytics** by making sure the filter icon in the navigation bar is disabled.
  2. Go to the [Site Overview](#{site_path(@site)}) page and hover over the histogram to see the number of monthly searches over time. You can also view your data over time on the [Monthly Reports](#{site_monthly_reports_path(@site)}) page.


  You’ll need to manage your transaction/query levels with the commercial provider. If you run out, our Search Results API won’t return any web results.


  Detailed tips on how to buy a commercial API key follow.


  ## Bing Search APIs


  ### Step 1. Cognitive Services: Bing Search APIs


  You can buy “[Bing Search APIs](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/search/)" from the Microsoft Azure Marketplace.


  A subscription to Cognitive Services Bing Search APIs gives you access to both web and image searches for use with the Search.gov Results API.


  ### Step 2. Retrieve your Account Key


  The account key for your Bing Search APIs subscription should now be available on your [Cognitive Services Subscriptions page](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-US/subscriptions). Click "Show" for one of your keys and note the key value.


  ### Step 3. Get Bing Web and/or Image Results from Our Search Results API


  You’re now ready to use our Search Results API. Refer to our [Search Results API Instructions](#{site_api_instructions_path(@site)}) in the Admin Center for detailed implementation instructions.


  ## Google (Google Site Search)


  ### Step 1. Create a Custom Search Engine & Buy Google Site Search


  [Google Site Search](https://www.google.com/work/search/products/gss.html) is the paid version of [Google Custom Search engine](https://www.google.com/cse) (CSE). Site Search exposes the CSE results in JSON format. Create a free custom search engine first with the domains in our Admin Center and then upgrade it to Site Search.

  ### Step 2. Set Up Your Domains


  Configure and manage your domains in ***both*** your Google CSE account and on the [Domains](#{site_domains_path(@site)}) page in our Admin Center. The domains in the two systems must match to return the expected results in the Search Results API.


  ### Step 3. Find Your Account Keys


  Your paid Site Search is listed under CSE so, once you’ve bought Site Search, log in to your Google CSE account. Click on the search engine you created. Then go to Business -- XML and JSON to find the two values you need, your `key` and `cx`.
