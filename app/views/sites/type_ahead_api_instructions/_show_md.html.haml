  ## Overview

  This API exposes the type-ahead suggestions that can appear below your search box as searchers enter their search terms. We have a script available that calls this API for you, which you can use as an alternative to using this API directly. Find it in on the [Code Snippets page](#{site_embed_code_path(@site)}).


  ## Getting started

  Please refer to the detailed documentation for the Results API, now publicly available through the [OpenGSA Portal](https://open.gsa.gov/api/searchgov-suggestions/). The information below serves as an introduction.


  ## API Key and Resource URL

  The endpoint is `https://api.gsa.gov/technology/searchgov/v2/sayt`.

  The following pre-formatted example contains the required parameters in their correct form for this specific search siteâ€™s suggestions.

  * The `name` is your site handle. You can find your site handle on the [Settings](#{edit_site_setting_path(@site)}) page.
  * Your `api_key` is provided through [api.data.gov](https://api.data.gov).
  * Replace `YOUR_SEARCH_TERM` with the query as entered into the search box. Send a new call for every keystroke. Whenever a user selects a query from the drop-down list, send this selection to us as a new query request.
