  %ul.bulk-upload-instructions
    %li
      Create a plain text file with a .csv extension.
    %li
      List one Affiliate ID per row in the first column. Headers are optional and will be ignored.
    %li
      Ensure the IDs listed correspond to the affiliates you wish to permanently delete. This action cannot be undone.
    %li Example format:
    %li
      %textarea{ rows: 3, readonly: true }
        123
        456
        789
    %li
      Save the file on your computer.
    %li
      Browse for the file using the field below.
    %li
      Click "Upload and Queue Deletion".
    %li
      You will receive an email confirmation once the deletion process is complete. This may take some time depending on the number of affiliates.
