  Bulk Zombie Url Upload
%p
  To upload a list of URLs to be deleted, follow these instructions:
  %ul.bulk-upload-instructions
    %li
      Create a new CSV file containing one URL and Document id per line.
    %li
      Document ID is mandatorily required to delete URL from Kibana when URL is not present in Search DB. An example of this format
      is shown below.
    %li
      Save the file on your computer; you can name the file whatever you like, as
      long as it has a .txt extension.
    %li
      %b
        Do not use Microsoft Word files, or any other file type except plain text.
    %li
      The maximum file size is #{number_to_human_size(BulkZombieUrls::FileValidator::MAXIMUM_FILE_SIZE)}.
    %li
      Browse for the file on your computer.
    %li
      Upload the file to Search.gov using the upload button below.
    %li
      You will receive an email when processing of your URLs is complete.
