      is shown below.
    %li
      Save the file on your computer; you can name the file whatever you like, as
      long as it's plain text and has a .txt extension.
    %li
      %b
        Do not use Microsoft Word files, or any other file type except plain text.
    %li
      The maximum file size is #{number_to_human_size(BulkUrlUploader::MAXIMUM_FILE_SIZE)}.
